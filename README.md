This is a Python implementation of the
[Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA)](http://unicode.org/reports/tr10/). It
passes 100% of the UCA conformance tests for Unicode 5.2.0 (Python 2.7),
Unicode 6.3.0 (Python 3.3+), Unicode 8.0.0 (Python 3.5+), Unicode 9.0.0
(Python 3.6+), and Unicode 10.0.0 (Python 3.7+) with a variable-weighting
setting of Non-ignorable.



## What do you use it for?

In short, sorting non-English strings properly.

The core of the algorithm involves multi-level comparison. For example,
``café`` comes before ``caff`` because at the primary level, the accent is
ignored and the first word is treated as if it were ``cafe``. The secondary
level (which considers accents) only applies then to words that are equivalent
at the primary level.

The Unicode Collation Algorithm and pyuca also support contraction and
expansion. **Contraction** is where multiple letters are treated as a single
unit. In Spanish, ``ch`` is treated as a letter coming between ``c`` and ``d``
so that, for example, words beginning ``ch`` should sort after all other words
beginnings with ``c``. **Expansion** is where a single letter is treated as
though it were multiple letters. In German, ``ä`` is sorted as if it were
``ae``, i.e. after ``ad`` but before ``af``.


## How to use it

Here is how to use the ``pyuca`` module.

    pip install pyuca

Usage example:

    from pyuca import Collator
    c = Collator()

    assert sorted(["cafe", "caff", "café"]) == ["cafe", "caff", "café"]
    assert sorted(["cafe", "caff", "café"], key=c.sort_key) == ["cafe", "café", "caff"]

``Collator`` can also take an optional filename for specifying a custom
collation element table as well as some keyword arguments to override the
default behavior.

You can also import collators for specific Unicode versions,
e.g. `from pyuca.collator import Collator_8_0_0`.
But just `from pyuca import Collator` will ensure that the collator version
matches the version of `unicodata` provided by the standard library for your
version of Python.


## Settings

``Collator`` can take zero or more of the following as keyword arguments:

* ``strength``
* ``alternate``
* ``backwards``
* ``normalization``

### strength

Takes the values ``primary``, ``secondary``, ``tertiary``, ``quaternary`` and
``identical`` and defaults to ``tertiary``.

Only considers levels up to the one given. For example, a value of ``primary``
will consider ``a`` and ``á`` the same (assuming the default collation element
table) and a value of ``secondary`` (or ``primary``) will consider ``a`` and
``A`` the same (again, assuming the default collation element table).

### alternate

Not yet implemented (defaults to ``non-ignorable``).

### backwards

Not yet implemented (defaults to ``off``).

### normalization

Takes the values ``on`` and ``off``, and defaults to ``on``.

If ``on``, the strings to be collated are first normalized to NFD. If your
strings are known to already be in NFD, you can set ``normalization`` to
``off`` for better performance.
